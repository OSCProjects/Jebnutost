# JEBNUTOSŤ
Overly complicated programming language, that is too hard to learn and made just for fun

## Reason

This langage was mainly made, for my other projects that are yet to come

#### These projects are:
| Name of project            | Short description                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OSJ | OSJ (Open source jam) is a fun little device designed for playing small games, made in jebnutosť and KiCad |
| OSVR | OSVR (Open source virtual reality) are a small indie virtual reality goggles project made in jebnutosť and KiCad |
| OSG | OSG (Open source guitar) is a guitar hero styled controller, made for broke people like me, made in jebnutosť and KiCad  |

## ! THIS CODE DOES NOT YET EXIST AND IS PURELY THEORETICAL !


## Reasons to learn this language

- Its usability across my projects
- Its coolness

## Documentation

Documentation is not yet made, but there are examples of my code in the repository ` examples `
